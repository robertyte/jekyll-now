It is so exciting to start this blog. But at the same time I am just lazy to write it. Oh well, the first signs of engineeration [becoming an engineer (auth. me)]. And this is the most thrilling part of the blog! So let's engineerate!

In this blog I will share the learning process and achievements while studying masters degree in UCL and beyond. Few first posts will be entirely from my dissertation on building a classification model for a rare medical condition, called Hereditary Angioedema. I will share high-level overview on the appraoch and complexities of the research, few algorithms adapted to tackle severe class imbalance, Apache PySpark implementation of under-sampling, few code excerpts for visualisation, etc. Hereinafter all the data used to illustrate some of the algorithms will be mock, i.e. not from the real data set used for dissertation research.
